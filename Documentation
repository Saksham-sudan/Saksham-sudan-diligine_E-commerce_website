Project: MERN E-Commerce Site (v1.0)
1. 📖 Project Overview
This document outlines the technical architecture for a lightweight, MERN-stack e-commerce application. The system allows users to browse a list of products, view details for a specific product, and manage a shopping cart.

The application is built with a decoupled architecture:

Backend: A Node.js/Express API responsible for database operations and serving product data.

Frontend: A React single-page application (SPA) that provides a clean, responsive UI and handles all user interaction and state.

2. ⚙️ Technology Stack
Category	Technology	Purpose
Backend	Node.js	JavaScript runtime environment for the server.
Express.js	Server framework for building the REST API.
Mongoose	Object Data Modeler (ODM) for MongoDB.
CORS	Middleware to enable Cross-Origin Resource Sharing.
Dotenv	Module to manage environment variables.
Frontend	React.js	Library for building the user interface.
React Router DOM	Client-side routing for page navigation.
Axios	HTTP client for making requests to the backend API.
Database	MongoDB Atlas	Cloud-hosted NoSQL database.
State	React Context API	Global state management for the shopping cart.

4. 🚀 Installation & Setup
Prerequisites
Node.js (v16 or later)

NPM (comes with Node.js)

A MongoDB Atlas account and a connection string.

A. Backend Setup
Navigate to the backend directory:

Bash

cd backend
Install dependencies:

Bash

npm install
Create a .env file in the backend root. This is critical.

Code snippet

MONGO_URI=mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@cluster...
PORT=5000
Replace the MONGO_URI value with your own MongoDB Atlas connection string.

B. Frontend Setup
Open a new terminal and navigate to the frontend directory:

Bash

cd frontend
Install dependencies:

Bash

npm install
5. 💾 Database Seeding
To populate your database with the provided dummy data:

Ensure your .env file in the backend is correct.

Run the seeder script from the backend directory:

Bash

# This DELETES all existing products and adds the new ones
node seeder.js -import
To clear the database, you can run:

Bash

node seeder.js -destroy
6. 🏁 Running the Application
You must run both servers simultaneously in two separate terminals.

Terminal 1 (Backend):

Bash

cd backend
node server.js
Output: Server is running on port: 5000

Terminal 2 (Frontend):

Bash

cd frontend
npm start
This will open the app in your browser at http://localhost:3000.

7. 🔌 API Endpoints
The backend serves a REST API at http://localhost:5000/api.

Method	Endpoint	Description
GET	/api/products	Retrieves a list of all products.
GET	/api/products/:id	Retrieves a single product by its MongoDB _id.

8. ⚛️ Frontend Architecture
Pages
HomePage.js: Fetches all products from /api/products and displays them in a grid using the Product component.

ProductPage.js: Fetches a single product using the URL parameter (:id) and displays its details.

CartPage.js: Displays all items currently in the CartContext.

State Management (CartContext.js)
Global state management for the cart is handled via React's Context API to avoid "prop drilling."

CartProvider: A wrapper component (in index.js) that holds the cart state.

State: cartItems (Array of product objects with a quantity property).

Functions:

addToCart(product): Adds a product to the cartItems array. If the item already exists, it increments the quantity.

removeFromCart(productId): Removes a product from the cartItems array by its ID.

Usage: Components access the cart state by using the useContext(CartContext) hook.
